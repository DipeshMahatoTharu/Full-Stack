# Final Day 1 Project (DO THIS NOW)
# 👉 Project: Simple “User Info Checker”
# Requirements:

# Ask user for:

# Name
# Age
# Student status (True/False)

# Then print:

# Greeting message
# Age category:
# If age ≥ 18 → "Adult"
# Else → "Minor"
# Student status message


name = input("Enter your Name :")
age  =int(input("Enter your age :"))

if age >= 18:
    status = "Adult"
else:
    status = "Minor"

print(f"Your name is {name} and your age is {age} so your are {status}")
